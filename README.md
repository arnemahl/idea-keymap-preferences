## Personal IntelliJ IDEA keymap preferences

These are my keymap preferences in IntelliJ IDEA.

#### Usage

1. Add [Arne-XWin-mod.xml](Arne-XWin-mod.xml) to your keymap folder for IntelliJ IDEA, found at e.g. `~/.IntelliJIdea14/config/keymaps` (this is the default location for IntelliJ Idea 14 on Ubuntu).
2. In IntelliJ IDEA go to `File > Settings > Keymap` and select **Arne-XWin-mod**.
3. Profit

#### What does it do?

This keymap is based on *Default for XWin* but adds, removes and overrides some shortcuts. The purpose is to have more similar shortcuts as almost every other application (and especially editors).

To see what's changed from *Default for XWin*, look at [Arne-XWin-mod_WITH_COMMENTS.xml](Arne-XWin-mod_WITH_COMMENTS.xml). (Note that the file will be alterd, most importantly the comments will be removed, if you select this file as your keymap in IDEA, which is why I keep a separate file with the comments).
